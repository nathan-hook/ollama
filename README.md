TO DO

Move your compose file and this readme file to github.


You copied your docker-compose.yml file from the Open WebUI github repository:
https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui

You then started the two containers using:
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

Then you had to create an account to login with.  You used a fake email address, test@test.com and 'password'
as the password.

Then you needed to download a model from Ollama:
https://ollama.com/library?sort=popular

FWIW, you have to be very clear on the name of the model you want to download.

You downloaded llama3:8b

Then you set that model as your default.

IDEAS

Try adding a new docker container for testing out Fabric:
https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric

Fabric is a CLI that has pre-built prompts that allow you to feed information into an AI model and get a summary of that information.
